# Reflections on “Software Engineering in the LLM Era”

This article reassures me that majoring in computer science is still a smart choice. It makes a clear case that LLMs are impressive and useful, but they remain tools rather than replacements. Engineers are the ones who catch subtle bugs, question shaky assumptions, make design and security decisions, and integrate pieces into a complete, reliable product.

I also value the focus on how the field develops talent. The author argues that junior engineers need real practice to grow: working through tickets, writing tests, fixing mistakes, and learning from reviews. Replacing that learning with vibe coding may look efficient, but it weakens the pipeline that produces strong senior engineers. I plan to keep building core skills and use LLMs to speed up my learning, not to skip the work that makes me a better engineer.

Very nice article and reflection. It's very nice to get reassured we aren't wasting our time majoring in computer science.
